## Context
Netseal Tech specializes in designing high-scale applications such as **Vehicle GPS Tracking systems**, which process millions of data points daily, and **Chat systems** that facilitate responses to messages from platforms like WhatsApp and Messenger. We prioritize quality and adhere to robust coding principles to scale software efficiently.

## Problem Solving
When you receive a new task at Netseal or any other software company, follow these steps:
1. **Decompose the Task**: Break it down into manageable subtasks. You can use paper, flowcharts, or mental visualization to aid this process.
2. **Implementation**: Ensure that the solution meets the specified requirements accurately.
3. **Documentation**: Document complex parts of your code to facilitate future handovers to team members.
4. **Production**: Move the fully tested and reviewed code into production.

## User Story
In today's fast-paced world, efficient communication is vital. You are tasked with developing a Chat Messaging app that allows two parties to send text messages using only local state management.

## Requirements
1. **New Contact**: Automatically start a New Conversation with the First Message as `Hey {{Contact Name}}!`.
2. **New Conversations**: Should appear instantly for both parties in the Conversation List.
3. **New Messages**: Sending a new message should bring the Conversation to the top of the Conversation List in descending order.
4. **Delete Conversations**: Removing a conversation should clear All Messages and remove the conversation from both ends.
5. **State Management**: Implement all functionalities using in-memory reactive state without a real-time backend.
